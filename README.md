# Political-Extremism-and-Election-System

Authors: Adam Rohde, Xuan Huynh, Andrew Shapiro, and Brandon Thoma

Description: The conclusions of Bordignon, Nannicini, and Tabellini (2016) with respect to the
effects of runoff elections on political participation and policy volatility provide informative
results that positively add to the discussion of the benefits of different electoral
systems on societal political behavior and economic stability. The sensitivity of the
authorsâ€™ results survive the most common robustness challenges under a Regression
Discontinuity Design, yet unobserved confounding ultimately remains possible but
unable to be fully explored due to lack of Italian-specific knowledge. Additional studies
are ultimately necessary to validate the results for a more recent Italian electorate,
and to study the ability to generalize such results to countries outside of Italy.
